\arguments{
\item{ids}{body IDs for hemibrain neurons present in the
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
 Sheet}, for which the user will attempt to make a match if one has not
been made already. Else, LM neuron IDs in the tab 'lm' when using \code{lm_matching}.}

\item{threshold}{the minimum normalised NBLAST score between query and target neurons, for the potential match to be show. If set to \code{NULL} then all hits can be shown.}

\item{mirror.nblast}{a flywire (rows) - flywire-mirrored (columns) normalised
NBLAST matrix. By default this is read from the hemibrain Team Drive.}

\item{selected_file}{the Google Sheet database to read and write from. For
now, defaults to this
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
 Sheet}.}

\item{batch_size}{the number of FAFB top matches to read from CATMAID in one
go.}

\item{db}{Either a neuronlist or the name of a character vector naming a
neuronlist. Defaults to the value of \code{\link{hemibrain_neurons}()}.}

\item{query}{a neuronlist of neurons for matching. Should correspond to the given NBLAST matrix.
Defaults to reading a transformed \code{most.lhns} from the Hemibrain Google Team Drive.}

\item{overwrite}{Whether or not to overwrite matches already made.
The neurons you could possibly be looking at are selected through
the arguments: \code{ids}, \code{column}, \code{entry}. If \code{ids} is \code{NULL} you will be given all neurons that have been assigned to your user on the
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google sheet}.
If \code{overwrite} is set to \code{"FALSE"}, you will not overwrite any matches that have already been made from among the selected neurons.
If \code{"TRUE"} (be careful!) then you overwrite made matches among the selected neurons.
If \code{"bad"} then you can overwrite made matches that are 'tract-only' or 'none'.
If \code{"review"} then you will only be shown already-matched neurons, which appear in green.
If you make no new selection (hit 't' to exit selection mode) then the made selection will persist.
If \code{ids} is not \code{NULL}, then the selected neurons will be further sub-setted by their unique id. Note that selection
also works with \code{superUser}, the default is to only take neurons allocated to you. In order to change this,
you can user \code{superUser=TRUE}.}

\item{column}{defaults to \code{NULL}, no further subsetting. Else, you can select a column from the Google sheet.
Only  neurons with a certain value (\code{entry}) in that column will be chosen for matching.}

\item{entry}{defaults to \code{NULL}, no further subsetting. Else, it is a value in \code{column}.}

\item{superUser}{if \code{FALSE} then you will only be given neurons flagged for your user. If \code{TRUE} then
you will be given neurons flagged for any user. To select whether or not you want to look at neurons with no match, neurons with a match
or either, use the \code{overwrite} argument.}

\item{flywire.good}{logical, whether or not to only take 'well traced' flywire neurons, as annotated by the Drosophila Connectomics Group. This relies on the status column retrieved
by \code{flywire_meta}.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the pipeline pauses for each neuron that is missing from the NBLAST/data set.}

\item{hemibrain.nblast}{a FAFB (rows) - hemibrain (columns) normalised
NBLAST matrix. By default this is read from the flyconnectome Team Drive.}

\item{repository}{whether to match up FAFB skeletons from
CATMAID (using \code{catmaid::read.neurons.catmaid}) or flywire (using \code{flywire_neurons}) for matching. Alternatively,light level
skeletons  (\code{"lm"}) from Dolan et al. and Frechter et al. 2019 (eLife), stored in the package \code{lhns} as
\code{most.lhns}.}

\item{user}{the initials of the matching 'users', i.e. you, which should also be recorded on the master matching google sheet. However, you can enter a new user
for the matches you make in R. If set to \code{NULL} then all users are 'selected'.}
}
\description{
Match up neurons between the hemibrain, FAFB and light level data and save the
  result using a
  \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
  Sheet} on the hemibrain Google Team Drive operated by the flyconnectome
  group at the University of Cambridge. Your aim is to match the light blue neuron to the best red neuron!
  You must have access to the Team Drive
  in order to use this function. This function makes use of the Google
  Filestream application or rclone, which should be installed on your machine. Further,
  note that neurons are read from the FAFB CATMAID project when \code{repository=="CATMAID"}, and you must have
  login details for this project recorded in your .Renviron for these
  functions to work. You are given neurons assigned to your initials on the matching google sheet (the \code{user} column)
  though you can look at other's assigned matches using \code{superUser=TRUE}. Your selection is further narrowed
  by omitting neurons whose matches have already been made, when using the default \code{overwrite="TRUE"}. However, you
  can change this to overwrite matches, and to review made matches.
}
\details{
Currently, the
  \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
   Sheet} is set up with  limited number of users, each of whom have been
  assigned a number of neurons to match up. In order to add yourself as a
  user, simply open this Google Sheet in your browser and add your initials
  to neurons of your choosing on the rightmost column 'users'. Once a match
  is recorded, the user selects a quality for that match. There can be no
  match (none), a poor match (poor) an okay match (okay) or an exact match (good). As a
  rule of thumb, a poor match could be a neuron from a very similar same cell
  type or a highly untraced neuron that may be the correct cell_type. An okay
  match should be a neuron that looks to be from the same morphological cell
  type but there may be some discrepancies in its arbour. A good match is a
  neuron that corresponds well between FAFB and the hemibrain data.
