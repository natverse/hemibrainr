\title{Calculate a connectivity similarity score between two connectivity profiles}
\usage{
hemibrain_connectivity_similarity(x, y, c1 = 0.5, c2 = 0.18, normalise = TRUE)

\method{hemibrain_connectivity_similarity}{numeric}(x, y, c1 = 0.5, c2 = 0.18, normalise = TRUE)

\method{hemibrain_connectivity_similarity}{matrix}(x, y, c1 = 0.5, c2 = 0.18, normalise = TRUE)

hemibrain_connectivity_similarity_distance(
  m,
  c1 = 0.5,
  c2 = 0.18,
  normalise = FALSE,
  diag = FALSE,
  upper = FALSE
)

hemibrain_connectivity_similarity_matrix(
  m,
  c1 = 0.5,
  c2 = 0.18,
  normalise = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector/matrix of connectivities, where each entry in the vector or each column in the matrix is a different target/input neuron/cell type}

\item{y}{a different vector/matrix of connectivities}

\item{c1}{determines how negatively we want to punish a case such as the one above. Default C1 is chosen so that 1 and 5 are weakly dissimilar.}

\item{c2}{determines the point where the similarity of the two numbers switches from negative to positive. Default C2 is chosen so that 10 and 100 synapses are weakly similar.}

\item{normalise}{perform a min-max normalisation on the similarity scores as in Schlegel et al. 2015}

\item{m}{an n x m adjacency matrix}

\item{diag}{for connectivity_similarity_distance. Logical value indicating whether the diagonal of the distance matrix should be printed by print.dist.}

\item{upper}{for connectivity_similarity_distance. Logical value indicating whether the upper triangle of the distance matrix should be printed by print.dist.}
